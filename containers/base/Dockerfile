# note: ldconfig looks strange. contrail-lib installs shared libraries but do not call it...
# note: we decide to install python3 packages by pip because they are absent in RHEL7/CentOS7 repos.
# these two packages (six, future) are installed here because they are needed for contrail-utils at least.
# further all deps should be moved to modules itself and here we must use requirements.txt to install deps.
# and one more next step is to install python modules from sources without creating RPM.
# WARNING! all pip deps must be installed with pinned version to avoid breakages when pypi is upgraded.
# WARNING! python2-setuptools is to be installed as it here below to get correct version -
#   from the yum repo install via BASE_EXTRA_RPMS. pip2 is to installed BEFORE python3 that installs pip3
#   byt dependencies. 
# NOTE! all other deps must be installed in the container that requires such deps.
